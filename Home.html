        <p>
            If you're interested in learning about R, I created an article titled <a href="/articles/what-is-r/">What is R?</a> that provides a brief introduction.
            It also explains why R has become so popular for data analysis and data visualization.

        <p>
            I was a guest speaker at the <a href="http://www.iowacodecamp.com/" target="blank">Iowa Code Camp</a> in Iowa City today.

        <h2>2013-01-01 - Data Explorer Public Preview</h2>
        <p>
            After a year of development, I'm releasing the first public preview of my <a href="http://www.data-explorer.com" target="blank">Data Explorer</a> software.
            I'm not sure if there is a market for this software yet, so I'm just going to get it out there and start collecting feedback.
            If all goes well, I'll continue developing it for another year, release quarterly updates, and plan for a final release sometime in 2013.
