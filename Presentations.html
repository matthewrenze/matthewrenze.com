                Data science is revolutionizing the world around us. 
                We’re incorporating artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data-driven decision making into all aspects of business. 
                However, many software developers have yet to learn how to leverage these practices to create better software. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this presentation, we’ll learn how expert developers are using data science to create better software. 
                We’ll learn how to use data analytics, machine learning, and anticipatory design to create more intelligent software. 
                In addition, we’ll learn how to use data from our dev-ops pipeline to improve our software development practices.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Does your career as a software developer cause you stress? 
                What are you currently doing to manage the negative health effects of this stress? 
                Software developers are uniquely predisposed to certain stress-related mental-health issues. 
                The key problem is that we evolved to survive in a wilderness context. 
                However, these same survival adaptations are now in direct conflict with our modern high-tech world. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                In this session, we will learn about the behavioral neuroscience of mindfulness practices. 
                We’ll discuss practices like meditation, biofeedback, cognitive reappraisal, organized skepticism, and egoless programming. 
                In addition, we will learn how we, as software developers, can use these practices to reduce stress, improve our mental health, and increase our focus. 
                There will be NO new-age nonsense, mystical mumbo-jumbo, or quantum flapdoodle in this session… only research-based science… real science… in plain English.

                As software grows more complex, we need to manage this complexity by using various architectural patterns, practices, and principles. 
                In this session, we will learn how software experts keep their architecture clean using a new approach to software architecture. 
                We’ll learn about domain-centric architectures, application layers, CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Separation), event sourcing, microservices, and more. 
                You can expect to hear practical advice and see real-world examples from over 17 years of architectural experience.

            <p>
                Clean Code is a philosophy of writing code for the reader of the code rather than for the author or for a machine. 
                Writing code that is clean is extremely important because of the high maintenance cost associated with messy code. 
                In this session, you will learn from industry experts what makes code clean. 
                In addition, you will learn how to write reader-centric code that is simple, readable, understandable, maintainable, and testable.

                Most presentations on Agile practices only cover what Agile is and how Agile practices work.
                However, in this session, we'll discuss why Agile practices like Scrum, TDD, and refactoring are so effective in terms of economics, psychology, and science.
                In addition, we'll explain the success of Agile practices with insights from various scientific fields including Information Theory, Network Theory, and Systems Theory.
                Whether you're still unsold on the value of Agile, actively practicing Agile, or need to convince others of the value of Agile, this presentation is for you.
