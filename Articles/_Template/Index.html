        <p>
            <p>
                The question I get asked most frequently these days is "How do I get
                started with data science". This question come not just from software
                developers but also managers and even C-level executives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. So, I usually have to
                ask several qualifying questions to determine each individual's background,
                motivations, and constraints. However, over the years, I've noticed some
                pretty clear patterns emerge from my advice.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, if you're interested in getting started with data science, here are a
                few general paths that you can take. All three of these paths are listed in
                order, from the smallest commitment of time, money, and effort, to the
                largest.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Online Courses
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are hundreds of online courses available these days. Many are
                excellent courses taught by highly qualified instructors. However, there
                are also a lot of low-quality courses, simply trying to cash in on the
                latest IT trends.
            </p>
            <p>
                While it's hard to say which courses would be best for each of you, my
                recommendations generally fall into three categories, based on a person's
                background and motivations:
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">Data Camp</a>
                - If you're new to programming and you'd like to take things at a gradual
                pace, I recommend Data Camp. They use interactive exercises to walk you
                through all of the basic concepts. While this is a great approach for
                novices, more experienced IT professionals, however, might find this pace
                too slow.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://goo.gl/nkqVmF">Pluralsight</a>
                - If you're an experienced IT professional, I recommend Pluralsight.
                This option is best for those interested in quickly learning practical
                skills that you can apply at your job immediately.
                To help you get started, I created a data science channel that acts as a
                learning path for all of the necessary skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">
                    Coursera
                </a>
                - If you want to go much deeper into data science, I recommend Coursera's
                Data Science Specialization through Johns Hopkins. This 10-course series is
                taught by some of the top professors in the academia. However, this level
                of depth and mathematical background is definitely not for everyone.
            </p>
            <h2>
                On-site Training
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you have a team (or are part of a team) that wants to learn how to
                leverage data science, you might find on-site training to be a better fit.
                With on-site training, you can quickly get an entire group of people up to
                speed fast.
            </p>
            <p>
                On-site training is generally done as full-day or multi-day workshops for
                groups of between 10-50 people. The main advantage of on-site training is
                that you have a live instructor, which helps keep you engaged. In addition,
                you can ask the instructor questions and get immediate feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main downside to on-site training is that it costs more than online
                training. You need to have enough people to make this option cost
                effective. In addition, the faster pace of learning may actually be a
                disadvantage for those on your team that prefer a more gradual learning
                pace.
            </p>
            <p>
                I regularly provide this type of on-site training for start-ups to Fortune
                100 companies. This includes companies like Microsoft and their key
                clients. In addition, you can also find these same workshops at various    <a href="http://www.matthewrenze.com/events.html">conference</a> that I
                speak at around the world. You can learn more on my    <a href="http://www.matthewrenze.com/workshops.html">workshops</a> page.

                <a name="OLE_LINK2">
                    If you want to go really deep into data science, I recommend investing
                    in a degree from a reputable university. However, you need to have
                    sufficient time, money, and motivation to do so. While knowing the
                    basics can get you quite far in your career, being an expert can take
                    you to the top of your profession.
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the top data scientists in the industry generally have a Masters or
                a Ph.D. in data science, computer science, or statistics. In addition, if
                you're going to be using data science in ways that could have significant
                financial implications or affect health and safety, this is the recommended
                way to go.
            </p>
            <p>
                From my own personal experience, it's really easy to introduce errors or
                bias into the data science process. Having a deep understanding of the
                scientific method and statistics will help protect you from these errors in
                reasoning before you commit them.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Conclusion
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hopefully this is enough information to get most of you started down the
                right path. Once you get through the basics, you should have enough
                information to decide where to dig deeper.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if you're still not sure where to begin, I recommend starting with
                my introductory course    <a href="https://goo.gl/aPWB3H">Data Science: The Big Picture</a> It will
                walk you through the entire data science space from a very high level in a
                simple language anyone can understand.
